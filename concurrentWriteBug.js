In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't updating correctly in Realtime Database.  The issue manifested when multiple clients wrote to the same location concurrently.  Initially, I used `on('value', ...)` to observe changes, but this caused unexpected overwrites and data loss due to the asynchronous nature of the updates.  The `on('value', ...)` listener would often receive stale data and overwrite more recent changes.
